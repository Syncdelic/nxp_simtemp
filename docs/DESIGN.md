# simtemp Design Notes

This document tracks the evolving architecture of the simulated temperature stack and highlights portability considerations for both x86 development and ARM deployment targets.

## High-level structure

## Portability strategy

- **x86 development**: continue using `force_create_dev=1` for rapid iteration against Fedora kernels (6.x). The build scripts already handle Secure Boot signing via enrolled MOK keys.
- **Orange Pi Zero3 (Armbian 25 / Ubuntu 24)**: install matching kernel headers, include `kernel/dts/nxp-simtemp.dtsi` in a board overlay, and rely on native DT probing instead of the forced platform device.
- **Jetson Orin Nano (JetPack 6.2 / Ubuntu 22)**: the NVIDIA kernel tree is based on LTS kernels; ensure the `class_create()` compatibility macro remains valid and sign modules per Jetsonâ€™s toolchain if Secure Boot is enabled.
- **Common API surface**: maintain `nxp_simtemp_ioctl.h` as the shared contract between kernel and CLI so record layouts remain consistent across architectures.
- **Testing parity**: reuse the sysfs + poll regression steps on every target. Capture results in `docs/TESTPLAN.md` once the CLI is online to flag any platform-specific anomalies.

## Next steps

1. Implement the character device, ring buffer, and wait-queue driven alerting inside the kernel module.
2. Extend the CLI to configure sampling/thresholds and consume binary samples via `poll()`.
3. Add DT property parsing during `probe()` so ARM boards use their native configuration without module parameters.
